## 2. Environmental Impact Overview

StellarForge Events has achieved significant reductions in resource consumption and emissions by integrating recyclable materials (lightweight alloys and carbon composites) and deploying energy-efficient LED lighting across its modular structures. Manufacturing facilities powered by on-site renewables have cut carbon emissions by 40%, while overall environmental impact has fallen by 45%. Although water use is integral to fabrication processes, systematic metering is not yet in place to quantify total consumption.

Potential hotspots remain in logistics and on-site assembly. Transportation of large truss modules contributes to upstream GHG emissions, and reliance on rare alloys poses supply-risk and price volatility. Emerging material scarcity—especially of carbon composites and certain lightweight metals—could disrupt production timelines and increase environmental burden if alternate sources are not secured.

| Impact Category            | Actual Impacts                                         | Potential Impacts                                          |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Materials & Water          | 45% impact reduction via recyclables; water unmetered  | Supply-chain volatility for alloys/composites              |
| GHG Emissions & Energy Use | 40% emissions cut through renewables; efficient lighting | Transport emissions from logistics; energy price fluctuations |

Gaps  
- Absence of detailed water-use data  
- Limited mapping of logistics-related emissions  

Recommendations  
1. Install comprehensive water-metering and reporting systems  
2. Conduct a full-life-cycle assessment of transport and assembly  
3. Pilot alternative, locally sourced materials to mitigate scarcity

## 3. Energy Management and Emissions

StellarForge Events has made significant strides in decarbonizing its operations by leveraging renewable energy. 100% of electricity in its manufacturing facilities is supplied by on-site solar and contracted green power purchase agreements (PPAs), resulting in a 40% reduction in carbon emissions compared to the 2021 baseline. Across combined operations—including off-site event assembly—the company estimates that 65% of its total electricity consumption now originates from renewable sources, with the remaining 35% drawn from the regional grid.

Through these measures and the integration of energy-efficient LED lighting, StellarForge has driven down its emission intensity to an average of 0.6 t CO₂e per event and 1.1 t CO₂e per tonne of structural materials processed. This represents a 40% improvement in event-level emissions and a 45% reduction in material-processing impact since the launch of its sustainability program.

Potential impacts and future opportunities are centered on scaling renewable integration at remote venues and addressing evolving regulatory landscapes. By installing portable solar arrays and battery-storage systems at high-frequency event sites, StellarForge could increase its renewables share beyond 80%, further insulating against grid volatility. Meanwhile, emerging EU carbon-pricing mechanisms may expose 35% of current grid-sourced electricity to incremental costs of €30–€50 per tonne of CO₂e by 2030, underscoring the need for proactive risk mitigation.

**Energy Mix Overview**  
- Manufacturing facilities: 100% renewable electricity  
- Combined operations (including event sites): 65% renewable / 35% grid  

---

### Gaps  
- Lack of real-time energy monitoring at remote event locations  
- Limited on-site generation capacity for large-scale touring setups  
- No internal carbon price applied to grid electricity usage  

### Recommendations  
1. Deploy mobile solar-battery units at flagship event sites to target 80% renewable self-supply.  
2. Implement a unified energy management dashboard with real-time consumption and emissions tracking.  
3. Introduce an internal carbon price on all grid electricity to guide sourcing decisions and budget for future carbon levies.

## 4. Material Use and Waste Management

StellarForge Events has achieved a 45% reduction in material‐related environmental impacts over the past year by integrating advanced recyclable composites and lightweight alloys into its structure designs. Currently, 60% of all construction materials by weight are classified as fully recyclable, and 85% of operational waste streams are diverted from landfill through internal recycling programs. This shift not only underpins our commitment to resource efficiency but also supports our broader goal of cutting carbon emissions by 40% via renewable‐powered manufacturing.

Beyond raw recycling rates, StellarForge has implemented closed‐loop processes for aluminum and carbon‐fiber scraps, capturing 90% of off-cuts for remelting or repurposing. Our in-house R&D teams continue to refine composite formulations to improve durability while maintaining recyclability, ensuring that modular elements can be disassembled and reintroduced into production cycles with minimal down-cycling.

Looking ahead, we see clear potential to elevate waste diversion above 90% by 2025. By standardizing circular design principles—such as modular connections, tool-free disassembly and component remanufacturing—we anticipate cutting residual waste streams by an additional 20%. Collaboration with key suppliers on take-back schemes and co-development of high-recycled-content alloys will further close material loops and unlock new reuse opportunities.

Gaps  
- Absence of formal supplier take-back or remanufacturing agreements  
- Limited data on end-of-life fate for certain composite assemblies  

Recommendations  
1. Establish supplier partnerships for closed-loop alloy and composite recovery  
2. Integrate circular design guidelines into all new product development roadmaps  
3. Deploy a digital tracking system to monitor material flows from assembly through end-of-life
